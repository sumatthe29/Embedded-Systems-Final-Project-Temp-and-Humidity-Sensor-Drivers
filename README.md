# Embedded-Systems-Final-Project-Temp-and-Humidity-Sensor-Drivers
Final Project for ECEN 2370. Created drivers that would operate two humidity sensors, one located on a Pearl Gecko board and the other an external sensor attached to the Pearl Gecko through pinouts. The files showcased are source files for the final project  which was cumulative over the course of the semester.
